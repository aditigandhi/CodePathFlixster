### App Walkthrough GIF

### Notes
I ran into issues in allowing the gif to load in HackMD. After dragging the created gif, it wouldn't load in HackMD. I solved the issue by creating a new gif that took over the span of only 5 seconds from the original video, and then it worked! I figured that a larger gif file would be creating the issue.
