### Notes
Creating the gif that would be visible in github was taking me too long. I had to split up the gifs into two 1 second original videos and then it appeared. It was a bit frustrating, I wonder why it doesn't show on github otherwise.

### Notes
I ran into issues in allowing the gif to load in HackMD. After dragging the created gif, it wouldn't load in HackMD. I solved the issue by creating a new gif that took over the span of only 5 seconds from the original video, and then it worked! I figured that a larger gif file would be creating the issue.
